### ðŸ”¹ Project Structure

* Keep a **consistent folder structure** (`data/`, `notebooks/`, `src/`, `reports/`).
* Separate **exploratory code** (notebooks) from **production code** (`src/`).
* Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing large datasets or temp files.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Data Handling

* Never store raw data in Git â€” use external storage (S3, GCS, DVC, etc.).
* Keep raw data **immutable** (donâ€™t overwrite).
* Automate preprocessing steps with scripts/pipelines.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Reproducibility

* Pin dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.
* Use virtual environments (venv/conda/poetry).
* Set random seeds for deterministic results.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Coding Practices

* Write **modular, reusable code** inside `src/`.
* Follow naming conventions (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, etc. for branches).
* Add **logging** for data pipelines & model training.
* Write **unit tests** for functions (`pytest`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Notebooks

* Use notebooks for **EDA and prototyping**, not production.
* Keep them **clean and linear** (restart & run all before commit).
* Store important outputs (plots, tables) in `reports/`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Version Control

* Commit **code**, not raw data or large binaries.
* Use meaningful commit messages.
* Consider tools like **DVC** or **Git LFS** for large files.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Documentation & Reporting

* Keep `README.md` updated with setup, usage, and results.
* Document assumptions, data sources, and key findings.
* Generate reproducible reports (Markdown, Jupyter, or PDF).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Collaboration

* Use **branching workflows** (feature â†’ pull request â†’ main).
* Review code via pull requests.
* Follow **consistent coding style** (PEP8 for Python).

---

âš¡ Bonus: For bigger projects, add **CI/CD** (GitHub Actions) to automate tests, linting, and model training.
